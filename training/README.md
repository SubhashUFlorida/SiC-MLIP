# Instructions
## Step 1:  
Download the training data (*'train_data.pkl'*) and testing data (*'test_data.pkl'*) from the [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/q3i0kfc37l0tygk4vk6ng/h?rlkey=bf0m9bd6375wxrks2wo8is0su&dl=0).  
## Step 2:
Input the following in *'model_train.py'*:
* Path to training data (e.g., *'train_data.pkl'*)
* Path to testing data (e.g., *'test_data.pkl'*)
* Path to featurized data (e.g., *'features.h5'*)
## Step 3:  
Run *'model_train.py.'*  
**Note:** A model file will be saved as *'model.json'* and the potential files will be saved in the folder *'model_coeffs'*, unless the script is modified.
