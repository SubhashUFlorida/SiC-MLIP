## VASP Surface Reconstruction Validation  
**Description**  
To validate the MLIP's predicted dimer-row surface reconstruction, a subdomain of atoms from the MLIP LAMMPS surface reconstruction simulation was relaxed in VASP.   
The structure was relaxed over two relaxation runs, where the CONTCAR from the run1 folder was used as the starting structure for the second relaxation run i.e., run2.  The CONTCAR within run2 is the VASP validation of the MLIP predicted dimer-row surface reconstruction.
